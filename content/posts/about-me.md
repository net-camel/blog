I'm Alex!\
This is my blog.\
A father of a daughter.\
My current title is "Network Engineer". I see networks as part of a larger infrastructure.\
Configuring network boxes is boring, pulling metrics out of the log data and knowing exactly when there is an error present on the box is fun!\
Cooking is also fun.\
So are PC games, expect for most live service ones.\
I have some houseplants too.\

I'm Alex!\
\
A proud father of a daughter.\
A grateful fiance of a beautiful woman.\
\
My current title is Network Engineer. I'm aiming to move into a role with more infrastructure and devops.\
Configuring network boxes is boring, pulling metrics out of the log data and knowing exactly when there is an error present on the box is fun!\
So is automating a boring configuration change to affect dozens or thousands of boxes at once, without having to sign into a single box.\
\
Cooking is also fun.\
So are PC games, expect for most live service ones.\
I have some houseplants too.\
